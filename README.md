# Wiki
Resource for Programmers!

## Editing Online
Just use the online editor: https://github.com/stormbots/Wiki/wiki

This is great for simple changes

## Using Locally
Great for bigger changes, or working on code samples. 

Don't clone the repository as normal. Instead, use the special format to access the Wiki part of this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/stormbots/Wiki.wiki.git`

It'll now work as normal in tools like VSCode.
